**Based on global configuration**

  - *Show a maximum of a certain number of items per screen*
  - *Hide or show completed items in the list*

**Implement this using context**

  - *Create a context for managing application display settings and provide this at the application level*
  - *Display or Hide completed items (boolean)*
  - *Number of items to display per screen (number)*
  - *Default sort field (string)*
  - *Manually set (hard code) those state settings in the context providerâ€™s state, they should not be changeable*
